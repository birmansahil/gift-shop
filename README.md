# Gift Shop Webpage

This project is a fully responsive webpage, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. for a fictional gift shop, My Valentine. It showcases products, features, and offers an intuitive design that enhances the user experience. The webpage has been coded by me, but the design was created by Kat Edwards.

## Technologies Used

- CSS3 for styling and responsive design.
- JS for responsive navbar.
- Font Awesome for icons.
- Google Fonts for typography.

## What I Learned

- CSS Flexbox and Grid: Improved my understanding of building responsive layouts.
- Responsive Design Principles: Learned how to make a webpage adapt to different screen sizes using media queries.
- Semantic HTML: Used appropriate tags like <section>, <header>, and <footer> to improve structure and accessibility.

## Challenges Faced

- Navbar Responsiveness: Making the navbar work consistently across all devices was challenging, especially toggling visibility for smaller screens.
- Gradient Backgrounds: Understanding how to apply linear gradients while maintaining readability of text required several iterations.
- Layout Alignment: Ensuring all elements aligned properly in the grid layout across various screen sizes took time and debugging.
- CSS Debugging: Identifying and fixing issues with overlapping or unintended styles when transitioning from desktop to mobile.

The challenges helped me grow as a developer and taught me patience and problem-solving skills. Seeing the final product take shape was incredibly rewarding and has motivated me to take on more complex projects in the future.
